# What is a binary tree?
A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children. The children are usually referred to as the left child and the right child. Binary trees are a fundamental data structure in computer science, and they are used in a wide variety of applications, such as sorting, searching, and data compression.

What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree?
The main difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree is that the nodes in a Binary Search Tree are arranged in a specific order. In a Binary Search Tree, the value of each node is greater than the values of all of its left children and less than the values of all of its right children. This property allows Binary Search Trees to be used for efficient searching and sorting.

# What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists?

Binary trees can have a significant gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists for certain operations, such as searching and sorting. This is because binary trees can be traversed more efficiently than linked lists. For example, the time complexity of searching for a node in a binary search tree is O(log n), while the time complexity of searching for a node in a linked list is O(n).

# What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree?
The depth of a binary tree is the length of the longest path from the root node to a leaf node. The height of a binary tree is the length of the longest path from the root node to a node with no children. The size of a binary tree is the number of nodes in the tree.

# What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree?
There are four common traversal methods for binary trees:

Preorder traversal: Visit the root node, then visit the left subtree, and finally visit the right subtree.

Inorder traversal: Visit the left subtree, then visit the root node, and finally visit the right subtree.

Postorder traversal: Visit the left subtree, then visit the right subtree, and finally visit the root node.

Level order traversal: Visit the nodes at each level of the tree, starting from the root node.
# What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree?
A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which all levels of the tree are completely filled, except for the last level, which may be filled from left to right. A full binary tree is a binary tree in which every node has either two children or no children. A perfect binary tree is a binary tree in which all levels of the tree are completely filled, and all leaf nodes are at the same level. A balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the heights of the left and right subtrees of any node never differ by more than one.
